## Project Description :page_facing_up

How does a developer/project protect the integrity of data whose value/sensitivity outlives the blockchain.

This RFP seeks solutions that address two categories of scenarios:

1. When a chain is voluntarily/gracefully shutdown.
2. When a chain involuntarily breaks down, that is ["... price and demand both collapse to zero."](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4756)

There are multiple chain types in the Substrate ecosystem:

1. Relay chains
2. Parallel chains
3. On-demand chains

These target different use cases.  The Substrate project provides tools to develop tokens for any use case. The documentation to develop tokens for [arbitrary](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts/build-a-token-contract/) use cases are provided.  Specifically, there is no guidance or warning about token designs that, under defined conditions, are known to breakdown. There is no guidance or warning about storing sensitive data on a chain that can be shutdown, see [How do you EOL/wind up/shutdown a relay chain and parachain?](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/9341/how-do-you-eol-wind-up-shutdown-a-relay-chain-and-parachain). There is no documentation describing chain configuration options relevant to shutting down a chain. There is no documentation describing chain configuration options relevant to a chain breaking down. There is no documentation about configuring a chain such that, under known defined conditions, they are resilient to said breakdown.

Those observations establish: There is **no** reason to believe that such breakdowns cannot or will not occur. There **is** reason to believe that chains may be shutdown in a manner that leaves user data vulnerable.

There is a [workaround suggested for a shutting down a parachain](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/a/9371/3344). However, the advice was:

> A lot of assumptions break down if someone gains control of the relay chain. Indeed parachains are basically only as secure as the relay chain. Thank fully, the relay chain is designed to be VERY secure. I don't think there is really something specific to address here, but yeah i mean if you have something specific, you should write it down.

The claim above appears to refer to the cryptographic-security of the relay chain. However, it does not address the functional-security or what is sometimes termed the economic-security of the relay chain.

At the time of writing, there are two descriptions of the token properties where it is known that the token economy (platform) can breakdown:

1. [Sockin, Michael, and Wei Xiong. “Decentralization through Tokenization.” The Journal of Finance 78, no. 1 (2023): 247–299.](https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13192)
2. [Sockin, Michael, and Wei Xiong. “A Model of Cryptocurrencies.” Management Science, Forthcoming.](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4756)

While these descriptions are stylized they produce [concrete scenarios](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4756).

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

***I emphasize an intent not to relinquish control by way of disclosure***

To fund the preparation and submission to the SEC of a initial consumer token design (Type-I). Requesting a no-action letter permitting the offer and sale of such tokens/coins in a manner and under circumstances suitable for use in a permissioned blockchain, without registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act and Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The no-action letter request will be the first of three (possibly four) incremental submissions, culminating in a token design suited to operating a blockchain in a decentrailized/permissionless configuration. These later designs are the subject of subsequent grant funding rounds. The ultimate goal is to create a compliant token design that (**initially**) is licensed to and utilized by blockchain networks such as Polkadot, Kusama and their network/ecosystem projects (purchasers of parachains, coretime, and the like), hereafter Dotsama. In the intermediate state, operate under a model where the licensor (the grantee) seeks SEC approval for a token design, which is then available to be licensed to a licensee (e.g. Polkadot, Astar, etc.) for public issuance and sale. Offer a fixed and variable cost subscription model for the licensee. Subsequent token designs will attempt to: 1) obtain SEC approval that relaxes the licensing requirement, 2) make subscriptions optional (at the cost of sub-optimal efficiency/performance).

### NOTE

***Declining to award this grant project (rejecting the PR) will not prevent the Dotsama ecosystem members from licensing the initial and subsequent token designs.  However, such licenses will only be available to the Dotsama ecosystem twenty (20) years after the date the first decentralized token design is licensed (timelines adopted from Polkadot patent).  Currently, it is expected there will be three (3) incremental token designs that culminate in a token design suitable for use in a permissionless/decentralized network.  Dotsama members can apply for licences before the twentieth year, provided they fully withdraw from and cease all activity in the Dotsama ecosystem, and do not participate in any non-compliant network/ecosystem, for the duration of their license.***

### Overview

- **Tagline:** Developing a consumer (non-security/investment instrument) token design compliant with SEC regulations to facilitate blockchain network operations without securities registration requirements.
- **Description:** This project aims to fund the development and submission of a token design to the SEC, seeking a no-action letter that would allow the offer and sale of such tokens/coins without the need for registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act and Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The project will proceed through four (4) milestones: initial development and presentation, SEC application letter development and submission, SEC interaction and iteration, obtaining the final no-action letter, establishing Implementation Fora and onboarding Implementation Fora members. The ultimate goal is to create a compliant token design that can be utilized by blockchain networks such as the Dotsama ecosystem.
- **Integration with Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama:**  The project is linked to the Dotsama ecosystem as it seeks to create a token design that Dotsama projects will be eligible to license. The initial Type-I token design is suited to permissioned use cases. By achieving SEC compliance, the project will enable permissioned Dotsama vendors to offer and sell tokens to the public without the regulatory burden of registration, thereby enhancing the network's ability to expand and operate within existing legal frameworks. This integration will ensure that the Dotsama ecosystem can grow and attract a broader user base, leveraging the compliant token design for various blockchain applications.
- **Team's Interest in the Project:** I am deeply committed to advancing blockchain technology, ensuring its regulatory compliance and that it is used to **undermine designs and practices that seek to exploit network effects to establish cartels, oligopolies and monopolies**. By developing a token design that meets SEC requirements, I aim to bridge the gap between innovative blockchain solutions and regulatory frameworks. This project reflects a mission to foster secure, legal, and widespread adoption of blockchain technology. My expertise positions me uniquely to undertake this groundbreaking project, and is motivated by the potential to set a precedent for compliant blockchain operations.

### Project Details

#### Mockups/Designs of UI Components

This project focuses on developing a token design, regulatory approval application and regulatory compliant implementation. The development phase of the token design will necessitate integration with blockchain network protocols. UI components are out of scope.

#### Data Models / API Specifications

The core functionality revolves around legal and regulatory compliance and then technical API development.
Consequently, the development phase of the token design will necessitate integration with blockchain network protocols, detailed implementation specifications will be drafted and updated based on feedback from the Implementation membership.

#### Technology Stack

- Document Management: Overleaf, LaTeX, Git
- Implementation Fora: Discourse, Telegram
- Blockchain Integration: Substrate, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).

#### Documentation of Core Components, Protocols, Architecture

- Token Design Document: Document outlining the token's design, regulatory considerations (economic), compliance measures, protocol requirements and implementation notes.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)/Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Prior work includes extensive research on SEC regulations and the development of preliminary token designs suitable for blockchain networks.
Further PoC/MVP work will be involved while drafting the initial no-action letter request and obtaining feedback from regulators.

#### Implementation Fora

- Each sponsoring ecosystem/organization (here, the Web 3.0 Foundation) will have a minimum of three (3) member positions reserved in the Implementation Fora.
- The Implementation Fora will have a maximum of 100 members in each venue.
- Fora members will be required to provide their real names, affiliations and a minimum level of professional information.
- Limited to accepted ecosystem members to ensure high quality discussions.
- Members are first nominated by the ecosystem sponsor, in this case the Web 3.0 Foundation.
- Members membership fees are to be paid by the sponsoring ecosystem (this ensures the sponsoring ecosystem exercises some quality control).
- Memberships will be granted based on expertise and experience generally and specifically in blockchain and token coding and analysis.
- Members must agree to background checks, interviews, referee checks and sign NDAs binding until the public launch of the final (possibly Type-III or Type-IV) decentralized token design.
- Members must agree to a liability indemnity agreement.
- Members must agree that all source code contributions are made under the dual Apache 2.0, MIT license or equivalent, and are released upon the first Type-I token license being granted.
- Members must agree to adhere to the Implementation Forum minimum best practices and standards on code quality, documentation, testing, and security.
- Members must agree to a three strikes and out policy for non-compliance with the Implementation Forum guidelines, and this is at the sole discretion of Mark Van de Vyver.
- Fora:
  - Implementation Forum (Private): Discourse forum for detailed and high-level long form technical discussions on integrating the compliant Type-I token design with Blockchain protocols.
  - Implementation Chat (Private): Telegram forum for short ephemeral exchanges on integrating the compliant Type-I token design with Blockchain protocols.

#### Project Limitations / Out of Scope
